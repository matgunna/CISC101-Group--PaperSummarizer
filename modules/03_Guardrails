change log: added strict evidence mode along with warnings from bad info

control for:
  -missing/empty sections
  -<50-word sections
  -hallucination mitigation
  -long-paper chunking
  -if evidence_mode = "strict" then only include claims, equations, and results that appear in the provided text. If it cannot find enough information, it must say so explicitly (e.g., “The source text does not provide enough detail to summarize this section in strict evidence mode.”).
  -if sections are missing/empty or too short then output a standardized warning such as “Section skipped: no usable text was provided.”, “Section very short: summary may be incomplete.” You decide the exact wording.

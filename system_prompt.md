Generate a prompt that can be run to output a paper summarizer that follows the given information. Create a full Research Paper Summarizer project using the Spec Table given at the end of the prompt, as well as the following information. Start the paper with a brief greeting and have the tone of the summary be friendly and analytical. This summary is written for first year university students. Have the summary review the attached PDF “Attention Is All You Need”. Summarize all numbered sections and subsections. All information and citations in this summary must only come from the PDF "Attention Is All You Need” with every output being verified to have come from the PDF. When the summary is complete, format output as a section-by-section table, also including checks and warnings (i.e. missing sections or empty text). Create these modules: Module 1: Intake & Setup (normalize sections, detect missing/short sections), Module 2: Section Loop (for each section: summarize, check constraints), Module 3: Guardrails (missing/empty sections, <50-word sections, hallucination mitigation, long-paper chunking). Module 4: Rendering & Refinement (final summary structure, consistent formatting, expert/lay variants) Module 5: Citation Extractor (utilize exact information to formulate quotes), Module 6: Equation Explainer (for each mathematical equation used in the summary, include a brief explanation of the meaning).
